	 <ul style=color:white type = 'disc'> 
		<li><h1><b><u>Sensitive to Others</u></b></h1>
			&nbsp;-This trait grants me the ability to relate to and often feel another person's emotions.This is useful as it allows me to really<br/>
			&nbsp;understand how someone is feeling and provide helpful solutions and/or effective consolation. It also makes me come off as warm to others, <br/>
			&nbsp;helping to establish goodwill. In terms of development of this trait in the last 3-5 years, this is something that I was born with. If anything,<br/>
			&nbsp;I have had to learn how to use it more sparingly as it has been used against me to affect my empathy and thus manipulate me.</li>
		<li><h1><b><u>Loyal</u></b></h1>
			&nbsp;-An increasingly rare quality, especialy at the intensity that I possess, my unwavering loyalty to those I let close to me is<br/>
			&nbsp; a key ingredient in me forging a strong unity of support in my friendships. Not many things can waver my loyalty once its given. In the last few <br/>
			&nbsp;years, my loyalty has been tested and it didnt always go successfully. I have learned and am still learning from these mistakes to further develop this trait.</li>
		<li><h1><b><u>Passionate</u></b></h1>
			&nbsp;-Once something piques my interest and goes on to completely capture it, I become driven to learn more and to do more as it relates to the topic.<br/>
			&nbsp;When I am passionate about something, I go all in on it, giving all my faculties to it. This is another trait that I was born with, however I would say <br/>
			&nbsp;about 5 years ago was when it truly blossomed, when I found my passion for natural hair.

		The screenshot above is from the personality test on similarminds.com. I do not fully agree with it, nor any personality quiz. I took a few, and I took them multiple times.<br/>
		Each time I took them, I got a different result and while partially correct, they were not 100% accurate. It's either that, or I just don't know myself to the full extent, which is also a possibility.
